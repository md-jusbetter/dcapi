''' zeromq server example.
    One front facing server and three workers are instantiated.
    Front facing server accepts connections from multiple clients and distributes computation requests among workers. 
    Also it collects computed results from workers and send the result back to the original client.
    Demonstrables:
        Multiple client connections.
        Work distribution among a pool of workers. '''
